## Pitch
This Application will allow you to view and query player, team, and game stats for NBA games available in the SportRadar trial NBA database. You will be able to look up and compare players or games in an easy-to-navigate and intuitive UI.

## End User
This App will be targeted at NBA enthusiasts who want to find statistical evidence to either inform their opinion or bolster their argument.

## Problem
